# Changes Made to Azure AI Agents Starter App

## Summary
Converted the project into a proper starter application with fixed code and updated project configuration.

## Code Fixes in BasicAgent.cs

### 1. Fixed Compilation Errors
- **Issue**: Multiple files with top-level statements causing "Only one compilation unit can have top-level statements" error
- **Solution**: Wrapped code in a proper `Program` class with `Main` method within the `Agents` namespace

### 2. Fixed Type References
- **Issue**: `ThreadMessage` type not found
- **Solution**: Changed to use `var` for type inference, allowing the compiler to determine the correct type from the Azure SDK

### 3. Added Proper Structure
- Added namespace: `Agents`
- Added class: `Program` with async `Main` method
- Added XML documentation comments
- Added console output for better user feedback
- Added configuration validation

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Added console messages showing progress (creating agent, thread, processing, etc.)
- Added better formatting for conversation display
- Added status messages for cleanup operations
- Added error handling for missing configuration

## Project Configuration Updates (Agents.csproj)

### 1. Set Startup Configuration
```xml
<StartupObject>Agents.Program</StartupObject>
<RootNamespace>Agents</RootNamespace>
<AssemblyName>AzureAIAgentsStarter</AssemblyName>
```

### 2. Excluded Example Files from Build
- Removed `StreamingResponse.cs` from compilation (excluded from build)
- Removed `OpenAPI.cs` from compilation (excluded from build)
- Kept them as reference files only

### 3. Cleaned Up Package References
- Removed XML formatting from package version tags
- Maintained all necessary dependencies:
  - Azure.AI.Agents.Persistent (v1.2.0-beta.6)
  - Azure.Identity (v1.17.0)
  - Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration (v10.0.0-rc.1)
  - Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json (v10.0.0-rc.1)

### 4. Fixed Build Issues
- Removed explicit `<Compile Include="BasicAgent.cs" />` to avoid duplicate compile items
- The SDK includes .cs files by default, so explicit inclusion was causing errors

## New Files Created

### README.md
Created comprehensive documentation including:
- Overview of the application
- Prerequisites and configuration instructions
- Authentication setup guide
- How to run the application
- Expected output example
- Troubleshooting section
- Links to Azure resources and documentation

## Configuration

### appsettings.json
Kept valid JSON format (JSON doesn't support comments) with:
- ProjectEndpoint: Azure AI Foundry project endpoint URL
- ModelDeploymentName: Deployed model name

Configuration details are now documented in README.md instead of inline comments.

## Build Verification

✅ Project builds successfully
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Output: `AzureAIAgentsStarter.dll`
✅ All dependencies restored correctly

## How to Use

1. Update `appsettings.json` with your Azure AI Foundry project details
2. Ensure Azure authentication is configured (e.g., `az login`)
3. Run: `dotnet run`

The application will:
- Create a Math Tutor agent
- Ask it to solve an equation
- Display the conversation
- Clean up resources

## Next Steps

Users can explore the example files by:
1. Including them in the build (modify csproj)
2. Changing the startup object to run different examples
3. Learning about streaming responses and OpenAPI integration
